# Todo

- [ ] refactor state of SearchMovie
  - this probaby has implications about the state of App.js entirely
  - I might be able to move the App.js methods closer to the form components that call them
- [ ] fix redirects and rendering to reflect updates and posts
- [ ] adjust providers array utility function to handle invalid/empty strings (BACK END)
- [ ] move Provider component to `src/components/subcomponents`
