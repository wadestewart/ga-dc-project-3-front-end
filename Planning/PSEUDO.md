# ga-dc-project-3-front-end

### Planning

!["Wireframe"](https://github.com/wadestewart/ga-dc-project-3-front-end/blob/feature-init/IMG_3461.jpg?raw=true 'Wireframe')

!["ERD"](<https://github.com/wadestewart/ga-dc-project-3-front-end/blob/feature-init/image%20(1).png?raw=true> 'ERD')

Our user story would be a user who wants to know if a movie is available on the major streaming services. They come to our app and are presented with a search field and button (pretty much the Google UI - if it aint broke). This field will have a placeholder for "movie name," once a name is submitted a results page will appear with movie providers that are streaming the searched movie.

There will also be a header with the app name and a navbar. The navbar will have a "create" link for users to create a movie. The user will have the ability to update and delete a movie in the database.


### MVP:
    1. Back End:
        [X]i. Node, Express, Mongoose
        ii. 2 Models:
            [X]a. Movie (Searching for)
            [X]b. Provider (Netflix, etc.)
        []iii. CRUD functionality
    2. Front End:
        []i. Handle API requests
        []ii. React Router (CRUD)
            [X]a. Create
            [X]b. Read
            []c. Update
            []d. Delete
        []iii. RESTful routes
        [X]iv. React App
    3. Deployment:
        [X]i. Heroku back end
        [X]ii. GitHub pages front end

We are going to tackle this project using pair programming. We will rotate the pairs throughout the project to ensure that each group member gets exposure to all aspects of front and back end builds.

Back end repo will be maintained by Hammad and Savannah.

Front end repo will be maintained by Wade and Kathy.
