# Project 3 - Streaming Movie Search Site

This is a group project, and our group is utilizing pair programming. We have divided the GitHub repositories into front-end and back-end, with myself managing the front-end repo and Hammad managing the back-end repo. The function of this application is to offer a user a search engine that will respond with the streaming service a requested movie is available on. If a user searches for "27 Dresses" they will be given the site where this movie is available to stream.

This application was built using the MongoDb, Express, and Node environment as a back-end API and React.js to render the front-end views. We have supplied dummy data for testing purposes, but initial research showed that a third party API could be utilized to get more robust, live data about movies and streaming services. However, time did not permit us to get to this feature. It will be installed at a later date.

Our approach was to plan and wire-frame the application as a group and then break into pairs to build the front-end and back-ends simultaneously. Features include *1.* Full CRUD functionality so a user can post, edit, and delete movies.
