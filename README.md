Our user story would be a user who wants to know if a movie is available on the major streaming services. They come to our app and are presented with a search field and button (pretty much the Google UI - if it aint broke). This field will have a placeholder for "movie name," once a name is submitted a results page will appear with movie providers that are streaming the searched movie.

There will also be a header with the app name and a navbar. The navbar will have a "create" link for users to create a movie. The user will have the ability to update and delete a movie in the database.

### Timeline:

Monday:
Have back end API created with 2 models (seeded with dummy data) by end of day.
Have 2 front end components: 1. landing page component with header, navbar, search form. 2. A search results page that reads and renders the data from the back end API.

Tuesday:
Have MVP completed - high fiveðŸ™Œ
